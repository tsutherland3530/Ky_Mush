This template provides a basic structure to get you started. You'll need to replace the sample data with real data about Kentucky's wild mushrooms, either by manually entering the information or by loading it from a dataset. You can also extend the functionality to include more features like searching by name or habitat.

Remember to import any additional libraries you may need for data analysis and visualization. For a comprehensive project, you might want to incorporate data visualization, machine learning for mushroom identification, and more, depending on the complexity of your class project requirements.

You're very welcome! I'm glad to help you with data visualizations using pandas. To create visualizations, you'll need to use a plotting library like Matplotlib or Seaborn in conjunction with pandas. Here's how you can create a bar graph, pie chart, and a line graph to represent the times of harvest, location, and poisonings. We'll also check for correlations between these data points.

First, make sure you have Matplotlib and Seaborn installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:

Now, let's create some sample code to generate these visualizations. You'll need to adapt this code to your dataset.

This code generates visualizations for mushroom harvest times, locations, and poisonings. The correlation matrix is included, but you might need to add more numerical data to see meaningful correlations. Replace the sample data and adapt the code to your specific dataset for a more meaningful analysis.
