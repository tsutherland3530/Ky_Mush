# Mushrooms of Kentucky Data Analysis Project

##Features

1]
Loaded the mushroom data from the CSV file (mush_d2.csv).
Cleaned and Operated on the Data While Combining Them: Cleaned the data and performed a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set.

2]
Cleaned the data and performed a merge using pandas to create a combined dataset, and then you calculated new values and created visualizations based on the combined dataset.
Visualize/Presented the Data: Made 3 matplotlib visualizations to display data.

3]
Created bar graphs and a pie chart using Matplotlib to visualize the mushroom data.

4]
Best Practices: Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.
Utilized a virtual environment, as seen in the README, providing users with instructions on how to set up their own virtual environment.
Interpretation of the Data: Annotated the code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md.

5]
You annotated your Jupyter Notebook with markdown cells, included clear code comments, and provided a well-written README.md, meeting the requirements for code interpretation.
