# Kentucky Mushroom Categorization Project

## Description

The Kentucky Mushroom Categorization Project is a Python-based analysis and visualization tool designed to catalog various mushrooms found across Kentucky. Utilizing data analysis and manipulation techniques, the project offers insights into mushroom species, their habitats, growing seasons, and edibility status. Aimed at mycologists, foragers, and biodiversity enthusiasts, this tool aids in the identification and understanding of Kentucky's rich fungal diversity, promoting safe foraging practices and environmental awareness.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed on your machine. This project relies on several Python libraries, including:
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
- seaborn (for enhanced data visualization)

## Installation

To get started with the Kentucky Mushroom Categorization Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ky-mush-project.git
   cd ky-mush-project
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies:

macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Windows:

cmd
Copy code
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
This project consists of several scripts that perform data analysis, manipulation, and visualization:

Data Analysis (mushrooms_NA_dic.py): Parses mushroom data, categorizes species by attributes such as edibility and habitat, and performs basic analysis.
Visualization (mush_d2.py): Generates visual representations of the data, illustrating distributions and trends of mushroom species across different regions and seasons.
Running the Scripts
To execute the main analysis script:

bash
Copy code
python mushrooms_NA_dic.py
To generate visualizations:

bash
Copy code
python mush_d2.py
